notes:
  - Good Iterations is founded on a passion to create digital teams that continually deliver great results. As a former software engineer I have built a strong empathy for what makes people who deliver, technical or otherwise, effective and what holds them back. Since my time as an engineer I have lead multiple teams across sizes and sectors to greater efficiency, enjoyment and success.
  - Every individual and organisation has unique talents. I work closely with teams to find the right approach for them. Too often models are applied wholesale, at face value and at the cost of the fundamental change they hoped to invoke. We will take elements from established models and innovate around them to find the best recipe for you. Identifying and communicating the true value of the models to your business is what I do. This brings lasting results.
  - I can provide consultation, but let's start with a conversation. If you're having difficulty building, driving and scaling effective teams please <a href="/#contact">drop me a message</a>. I would love to hear from you.
