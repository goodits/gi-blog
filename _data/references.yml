- name: Anouk Agussol
  title: Founder - Unleashed.Company
  note: Steve is one of the best coaches, leaders and problem solvers I know. He is set apart from other senior leaders because he doesn't only motivate and drive high performance from those that work with him, but he understands how to operate & scale. He is passionate about people (as a leader, coach), tech (as an engineer) and product (having worked agency side too). He can bring these three facets together to execute and deliver on something special. He moves fast, but he is thoughtful and reflective, being careful to make great decisions for the business and its people long term.
