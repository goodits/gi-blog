subtitle: More than just business, we're also on a mission.
notes:
    - Agile has lost its way of late, no longer fun and energising. It has become over diverged, debated and commercialised through mainstream adoption. The premise has become as much of a burden to engineers as it is a benefit. Ron Jeffries <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/articles/018-01ff/abandon-1/" target="_blank">summarises the position wonderfully</a>. We're at risk of losing Agile as we knew it.
    - Good Iterations is joining the movement to return to the core principles of Agile that transformed our industry. We don't insist you subscribe to practice x, y or z and spend your precious budget on middle-management to be masters of it. We will work with your existing team to fully understand the characteristics of high performing teams and software. The manifesto and principles made them clear and easy to adopt.
    - We love Agile. We're still grateful for it. We want to be part of the movement to bring it back to its roots.
