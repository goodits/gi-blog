subtitle: More than just business, we're also on a mission.
notes:
    - Agile has lost its way of late, no longer fun and energising. It has become over diverged, debated and commercialised through mainstream adoption. The premise has become as much of a burden to engineers as it is a benefit. Ron Jeffries <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/articles/018-01ff/abandon-1/" target="_blank">summarises the position wonderfully</a>. We're at risk of losing Agile as we knew and loved it.
    - Good Iterations is joining the movement to return to the core principles of Agile that transformed our industry. We won't insist you subscribe to practice x, y or z and spend your precious budget on middle-management to be masters of it. We will work with your existing team to fully understand the characteristics of high performing teams and software. We'll live the manifesto and principles.
    - We love Agile. We're still grateful for it. We want to be part of the movement to bring it back to its roots.
