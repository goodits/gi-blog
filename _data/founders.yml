  salutation: Hello!
  notes:
    - Good Iterations is founded on a passion to create digital teams that continually deliver great results and enjoy doing it. Starting my career as a software engineer I built a strong empathy for what makes deliverers, technical or otherwise, effective and what disrupts. Since then I have lead multiple teams across sizes and sectors, studying the teams and their environments.
    - Every individual and organisation has unique talents. Rather than prescribing a ready-made approach, I work with leadership teams to find the right combination of approaches for them, hopefully with opportunities for innovation along the way. Taking bits from OKRs, Scrum, XP, Lean, ITIL, Waterfall (yes, there were good bits there too) and more to find the best recipe for you. Too often these are applied by the textbook and at the cost of the fundamental change they hoped to provoke. Identifying and communicating the true value of the approaches and their application to your business is what I do.
    - I can provide consultation, but let's start with a conversation. If you're having difficulty building, driving and scaling effective teams please drop me a message. I would love to hear from you.
