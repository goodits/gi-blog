  notes:
    - Good Iterations is founded on a passion to create digital teams that continually deliver great results and enjoy doing it. As a former software engineer I have built a strong empathy for what makes people who deliver, technical or otherwise, effective and what holds them back. Since my time as an engineer I have lead multiple teams across sizes and sectors, studying the people and their environments.
    - Every individual and organisation has unique talents. Rather than prescribing a ready-made approach, I work with leadership teams to find the right combination of approaches for them. We would take elements from established models to find the best recipe for you. Too often models are applied wholesale, at face value and at the cost of the fundamental change they hoped to invoke. Identifying and communicating the true value of the models and their application to your business is what I do. This brings lasting results.
    - I can provide consultation, but let's start with a conversation. If you're having difficulty building, driving and scaling effective teams please <a href="/#contact">drop me a message</a>. I would love to hear from you.
