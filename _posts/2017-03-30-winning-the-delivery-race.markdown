The Formula One season kicked off this weekend. It reminded me of an anecdote I’ve used to explain the setting of an appropriate pace and the impact of technical debt in engineering projects. If you’re not familiar with the premise of technical debt, [check out this video by Ward Cunningham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE]){:target="_blank"} for a quick intro by the man who coined the term. If you’re not at least a little familiar with car racing, you may want to [read another post](/)!

If you’ll indulge a bit of over-simplification of the sport and some abstract thinking, I’m going to pick out a couple of success factors with parallels to highly effective teams.

## Looking after your tyres
Tyres are important for traction. The faster you race them, the hotter they become and the quicker they wear. You’ll get to the point where your speed drops, or they blow and your race is over. Too cold though and you won’t have enough grip to stay in the race. To win a race, you need to consider the amount of traction you’ll need in your tyres to stay competitive.

Technical debt in code, and its affect on your competitiveness,  is similar. The longer you pursue speed of delivery above platform health, the more debt you’ll build up and your capacity to move at speed will reduce. A strategy to race your vehicle as fast as possible for as long as possible is a quick way to hitting the wall, literally and figuratively.

*Unfortunately, my analogy doesn’t offer a way to pay off a little debt as you go. Conveniently forget that for a moment and let me bring your attention to the impact of your pace.*

A Formula One car has different engine modes that can influence your pace. You can imagine it as a slider. Too high and you’ll burn out your tyres. Too low and your competitors will leave an unbridgeable gap. Maintaining an appropriate pace (more on this later) is the key to a good race.

Picture the engine mode for your team and the race around you. Are you pushing hard to get a competitive edge? Are you maintaining a position, ready to respond to your competitor’s next move? How are those tyres looking? Time to change them maybe.

## Quick changes
Even the most cared for tyres will become aged. Despite all the wheel to wheel action in a race, it’s often in the changing of them where it can be won or lost. It costs time to change a tyre, but Formula One engineering has it down to an (albeit very scientifically informed) art.

Racing teams expect tyres to expire, so they have heavily invested in the interfacing of them to make sure they can replace them quickly. Imagine trying to change tyre with many connecting points, set to be replaced by another tyre with different mounting requirements. You can’t stop, you can’t change either. You’ll just have to run it as long as you can until you have no choice, which is likely to be too late.

Just like a racing team prepares to switch a tyre, you want to be able to switch out the worn parts of your software estate. It can be a good investment to create a decoupled software architecture, made possible through good interfaces. When part of your estate becomes tired and is preventing you from moving forward, you’ll be glad of your decision to put it behind an interface. You fit the new one and hit the gas.

## A winning strategy
So how do you win a race? A lot depends on what your competitors are doing and applying pace at the right time. The same can be said for your digital team.

When an opportunity presents itself, it may well be the right thing to put your metaphorical “pedal to the metal” and push hard for it. But consider the impact of that push. You’ll most likely have built up debt and perhaps the right thing to do next is to ease off a bit and have a more balanced approach to the management of debt for a while. However, if you’re lucky (and prepared) you’ll have built a gap over your competitors big enough to replace the debt-ridden component. Quite often, when you’re able to change your tyres and you come back out still in the lead, the top of the podium is yours.

Whatever the strategy is at any given time, make it known to the team. It’s the drivers who need to make those quick decisions on how best to execute it. After all, it’ll be [more fun for them too](/motivation/2017/03/15/millennial-maslow-jenga.html).
