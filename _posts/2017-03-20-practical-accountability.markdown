Creating accountability is a great way to scale productive and fulfilled digital teams. It can be an effective motivation tool and also help teams feel responsible for the success of a project. Once teams understand what’s expected of them, know how to achieve it and own the success they can progress without much oversight. You can get back to refining the strategy for the next project.

It doesn’t always turn out that way, though. Creating accountability is much more than finding out what needs to be done and handing it out. It can be very emotive and difficult to get right, but it is well worth trying to.

## Mutual understanding
To ask a team to be accountable is to trust them to achieve a result with little to no intervention. In order for it to be achieved independently, the vision must be understood. We often find that for a person to stay enthused to deliver something they need to be bought in to the purpose behind it.

A great way to build trust is not just to allow a peek behind the curtain, but welcome the team in and show them around. If they can share your understanding and the purpose behind the change, and have the capability to follow it, they’ll have all the need to go and execute against the vision.

It’s worth the investment in time to highlight the why before assigning accountability. Of course, some days it’s not practical. There will be times when short term opportunities require a bit of blind faith from your team. You should however be conscious you’re borrowing from a limited pot that will need topping up with more offerings of insight in the future.

## Problems, not instructions
Once your team understand the vision, let them run with it. Micromanaged accountability means your team feel all of the responsibility and none of the control. It’s a really uncomfortable position to be in. Feeling the need to micromanage would suggest the team were not ready to take responsibility, or the vision wasn’t communicated completely.

A team who understand the vision and are free to make decisions on how to pursue it can be highly effective. The team are being asked to use their extensive collective knowledge to find the right solution to your problem and should have few reasons not to feel accountable for the result. They’re likely to [feel more motivated](/motivation/2017/03/15/millennial-maslow-jenga.html), too.

## Trust and reporting
Not micromanaging does not mean being completely hands off, either. Accountable teams should expect to provide regular updates to leadership to settle any nerves around not having constant visibility. It’s super important that communication remains open and honest to maintain the original trust placed in the team.

Teams should also learn when to report by exception and re-engage leadership if they need further clarification or ideas. They will be accountable for doing this too late.

## It’s not a dirty word
Having been around ineffective accountability before, admittedly the word puts me on high alert. I still believe accountability is a key component to scaling teams. So long as it’s paired with empowerment and effective communication. Engaging the team fully in the problem and getting out of their way while they solve it is the route to true accountability.

I should note that I have observed highly skilled and accountable teams struggle with owning the decision making process. Where the accountability lies with the whole team, and not a leader within that team, decision making can be slower and more troublesome. A post for another day!
