How people are motivated to stay and progress in their roles is changing. It’s important that companies adapt to embrace the change or risk losing their top talent.

Recruitment and retention in digital has changed significantly over the past decade. There is ever increasing competition for technical hires. The barriers to entry for new software companies have lowered too. It’s becoming easier for small and typically innovative businesses to thrive - and recruit.

More effective remote working is set to make this more competitive still. There are a multitude of ways this is set to change digital recruitment (a topic worthy of a separate post). One impact on recruitment and retention is that your catchment area is now being shared by the rest of the world. Silicon Valley is now a short commute from your rural, British cottage to your nearest coworking space.

The days of the organisation who “pay well for the area” are numbered. They need a better selling point, and soon.

## The closing gaps

Since [Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs](http://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) was published, the basic human need is more easily achieved. This has elevated the aspirations of the modern worker.  

While water, food and shelter are available to the vast majority of people in employment, our Physiological needs are now measured by our level of comfort, and less by survival. Comfort is tradeable.

Availability of positions, especially in digital, also means our concerns around our ability to find employment is low. Safety needs - physical and mental aside - then become less of a concern. Job security can be worth a gamble.

Recruitment pages today will show photos of friends having fun together. Pampered with benefits and events from a company that would clearly love them. This seems to be a new battleground where potential hires hearts can be won and lost.

## The accessible peak

With fundamental needs met, so the other areas of human need become more accessible, and desirable. [Simon Sinek’s viral monologue on Millennials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hER0Qp6QJNU) highlighted the plight of the modern worker. Prepared (even expected) to fulfill their potential. To love and be proud of what they do.

With high numbers of available roles and a growth in remote roles, breaking down geographic barriers, they are likely to keep moving until they find it.

Something I have come to realise is that in the pursuit of the top of the pyramid, an individual  may trade off against the more fundamental needs, too. You need look no further to startup culture to see evidence of this. The desire to be a part of something special, to be respected and to fulfill your potential are big rewards. Perhaps even if physical comfort and safety, the fundamentals of human need, are a short term stake. There is a new romance around pot noodles in a garage.

## Borrowing from the base

Given the figurative safety net of the current digital employment climate, an individual may find there are times where they would accept borrowing from the foundations of their pyramid in pursuit of a higher goal. It can be more subtle than joining a startup. I’ve seen people move from the safest of positions among their very best friends to take up an opportunity at a reputable name and to challenge themselves.

In a top heavy pyramid, whether you’ve left your pals behind or hydrated food, you hope to restore these needs eventually. The increasingly frequent and significant observation is that more people are willing and able to take this risk.

##  Success in the competition for talent

Certainly not everyone is in this mould, and even the most stable of pyramids may be different to the next. A top talent in digital may want to be safe among friends. A top talent may just need to continue learning. A top talent may be all about the money.

The transition many tech companies need to make is to pay more attention to the esteem and self actualization of their teams. Strive to create opportunities that will make the most of their abilities and fill them with pride.

The companies who have the capacity to achieve the most across the board and accommodate many shapes will be most successful in their recruitment and retention.
